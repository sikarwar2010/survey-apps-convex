/**
 * Authentication configuration.
 *
 * Convex validates incoming JWTs against the providers listed here. The
 * mobile app uses `@clerk/expo` to mint tokens with the `convex` template;
 * each request carries that JWT, verified against Clerk's JWKS endpoint.
 *
 * Prefer `CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN` on the deployment (`npm run deploy` syncs
 * it from `.env.local`). The fallback keeps auth working if the env var was
 * never set on a deployment (common cause of "Convex + Clerk not linked").
